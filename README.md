# Py-Tags

### What is Py-Tags
Py-Tags is a small python project that helps me understand if the hashtags I am using are beneficial for my page's growth.

### What does it do?
Py-Tags will store a table of hashtags I use(depending on the service : *Youtube, Instagram, Tiktok*) and shows me the popularity, the weekly trends, and the activity of those hashtags. It also will give me feedback based on hashtag statistics, like letting me know if I am using too many hashtags(or in a range where it's too much), if I exceed a character limit, if one of the hashtags is really popular or really vacant. 

### How to use it?
I don't know, I didn't make it yet...
**However!**, It will be a terminal based program that will be easy to use and will store data and update data on every launch.
